# Finder for GithubUsers #
This is a small project where I built a finder for Github users. Just clone the project and run npm install, installs its dependencies and then npm run start runs the dev server. There is a example repo at https://henriksfinderforgithub.netlify.app/
You will need to register at github and provide the api keys to be able to use the application yourself.
